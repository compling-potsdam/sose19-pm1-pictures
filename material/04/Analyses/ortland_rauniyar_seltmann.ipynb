    "Based on the POS-tagging provided it turns out that around 0.39% (```1615``` out of ```411919```) of the words in the selected corpus are homonyms. It is assumed auto POS-tagging was used where the tagging seems relatively poor.Most of the phrase/sentences are not complete & gramatically seems incorrect which makes the POS-tagging dfficult. For an instance the below phrases used in the different context explain better:\n",

    "- Noun ('NN'), in the context `banana left of short fat chik`. Though `fat` as a homonym has noun meaning as well.\n",

    "## Exploring ambiguous objects in the VisualGenome corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to generate an overview of objects that are often described with ambiguous phrases.\n",
    "Imagine the Mona Lisa. One person would describe her as smiling where another person may say, she looks sad.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is, to take a look at an object in an image. There can be multiple regions that annotators selected that are overlapping with the object region. Annotators also supplied a phrase for each region describing what's inside. I have assigned a region to an object, if the overlap of their bounding boxes is at least 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the ambiguities between all regions to an object are calculated. I used the BLEU-score as the measure to compare the phrases and took the maximum BLEU-score as a measure for the ambiguity between the phrases. If the annotators said very similar sentences about the same object, the score will be high and low otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting mapping of objects to their ambiguity measure (BLEU-score), is then sorted. The 5000 objects with the highest ambiguity (lowest BLEU-score) are then frequency-counted. So if a object is often seen in a high-ambiguity situation, it will get more counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have visualized these frequencies below. Think of the frequencies as 'How often is an object occuring in a high-ambiguous situation?'\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting list roughly resembles the object counts of the corpus. However some terms look promising. For example 'plate'. It can mean the license plate of a car or a plate on the table. But also a steel-plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out more, I normalized the counts with the frequencies of the objects in the corpus.\n",
    "This resulted in another list that displays more uncommon words. Interestingly animals are common in the top 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thing to look at, would be to find out high-ambiguous relations and attributes. However due to time limitations, this has to be done in future work."
