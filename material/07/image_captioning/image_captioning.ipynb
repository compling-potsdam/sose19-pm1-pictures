    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the main objects in images \n",
    "* Convert an input image into a natural language description\n",
    "* Use encoder-decoder framework:\n",
    "    - The image encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN) – a resnet-152 model pretrained on the [ILSVRC-2012-CLS](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) image classification dataset\n",
    "    - The decoder is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    " * Hand-labeled ImageNet dataset (10,000,000 labeled images depicting 10,000+ object categories such as umbrella, dog, balloon)\n",
    " * Test images have no initial annotation (segmentation or labels)\n",
    " * The validation and test data consist of 150,000 photographs, collected from flickr and other search engines, hand labeled with the presence or absence of 1000 object categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition with top-5 error rate of 3.57%\n",
    "* Train extremely deep neural networks with 150+layers successfully\n",
    "* ResNet-152 achieves 95.51 top-5 accuracies\n",
    "* 2 layer deep (small networks like ResNet 18, 34)\n",
    "* 3 layer deep( ResNet 50, 101, 152)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip Connection\n",
    "* Mitigation of the problem of vanishing gradient by allowing this alternate shortcut path for gradient to flow through\n",
    "* Allow the model to learn an identity function which ensures that the higher layer will perform at least as good as the lower layer, and not worse tackling the degradation problem\n",
